# Conway's Game of Life

"Game of Life" invented by John Conway is a cellular automaton meant to simulate the development of a population of cells. Each cell behaves according to the following simple rules:

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

I have created my own version in React.js which can be found [here!](http://cgol.surge.sh)
